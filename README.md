## About the Project

This repository is part of a **scientific case study** conducted within the scope of a DHBW Mosbach Computer Science thesis.  
The focus is on improving the **maintainability** and **reliability** of the *HobbyDevs* web application, originally developed as a student project.

Key challenges in the existing codebase:
- High technical debt due to inconsistent coding standards  
- Incomplete and unstable features (session handling, database interactions)  
- Low and fragmented automated test coverage (Cypress non-functional, PHPUnit incomplete)  

The work in this repository does not only aim to repair the application, but to serve as a **systematic strategy for quality improvement**, documented with measurable software quality metrics.

---

## Objectives

1. **Baseline Analysis**  
   - Collect software quality metrics (Maintainability Index, Cyclomatic Complexity, Test Coverage, Bug Count).  
   - Document current weaknesses in architecture and implementation.  

2. **Refactoring for Maintainability**  
   - Apply systematic refactoring and introduce coding standards.  
   - Reduce complexity and technical debt.  

3. **Reliability Improvements**  
   - Repair broken features.  
   - Ensure robust session and database handling.  

4. **Testing & QA**  
   - Restore and extend Cypress frontend tests.  
   - Improve PHPUnit coverage for backend logic.  
   - Introduce automated CI/CD quality checks.  

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Compare quality metrics before and after improvements.  
   - Document findings in the context of software engineering literature.
